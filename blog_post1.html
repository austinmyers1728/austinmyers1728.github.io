        Over the past few years, I’ve had the opportunity to work on a number of challenging and rewarding research projects. From theoretical frameworks to applied machine learning systems, the journey has been as much about personal growth as academic discovery.
      </p>

      <p>
        In this post, I want to reflect on what I’ve learned — including both breakthroughs and failures — and share some advice for researchers just starting out. One key lesson: the value of patience and persistence in experimentation.
      </p>

      <p>
        I’ve also found that collaboration and communication play a crucial role in meaningful research. Talking through ideas with peers often led to insights I wouldn’t have found on my own.
      </p>

      <p>
        Moving forward, I plan to continue bridging theory and application in my work. Thanks for reading!
